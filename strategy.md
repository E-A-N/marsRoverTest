- build streaming interface to gracefully handle program input
    - extend to also handle program out
- build method for deciding chunksize (handle manually at 1st)
- hardcode the 1st line of program input as a header
- construct matrix based on the header size
- flatten the matrix to ease querys and indexing
- write utility for querying a position in the matrix at instant speed
- data model the robot (primarily for state handling)
    - add moveForward method to update the robots position based on its facing direction
    - add updateDirection to handle 90 degree state change for direction
- bind L, F, R to quantitative inputs to navigate the robot
- perform FIFO or left to right iteration of movement instructions
    - check if the robot is out of the matrix bounds
        - if out of bounds output current position with additional lost flag
    - when reaching the end of input log the current position
